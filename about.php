      <p>Da mailer`s is a company founded by a group of friends, it just only a dream of them to create a business, a business were the products is deserts and sweet foods. After they graduated in collage each of them find a job in different part of the world, they roam around and seek and tried different local pastries and specialties.
      After many years at work they finally save enough money and they return back to their home and once again reunited. They took basic training in baking and kitchen management. With different experience and flavor tasted they collaborate and tried to create new kind of pastries that suits the different taste buds of different people.
		As the people tried their products they gather the reaction and suggestion of customer and after they tried another product with new and much broader concept. To help the local grower they made products out of local supply but still in and very great quality.
		</p>
		<p> As years passed many people are talking about their products and so for that, they invest and open a franchising to all who are interested. And they also open the new idea for customer to customize the design of pastries and sweets for a certain occasion.
		Da mailer’s is now a huge company that has branches all over nationwide and now expanding to enter international stocks. The main goal is to promote the products made out of local goods.
		It’s truly the patience that can make an enterpriser successful just by waiting the right time to make a move with great preparation, new concept, ideas that true market is everyone to enjoy not on what it is but what’s in it. And they enjoy on what they doing and make a profit out it.
